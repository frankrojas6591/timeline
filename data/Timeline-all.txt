    - attributed to Christian persecution in when the Serapeum (a temple housing some of the library's collection) was destroyed. 
    - Christians led by Theophilus did destroy the Serapeum 
    - the Library of Alexandria had already ceased to exist in any recognizable form centuries prior to Hypatia's birth.[10] 
    - Finally, some accounts suggest a Muslim conquest in 640 CE led to the library's destruction, 
        though this account is disputed by some scholars. 
391 CE Judeo: (Serapeum destruction):
    - Coptic Christians, led by Archbishop Theophilus, destroyed the Serapeum, 
    - a temple housing some of the library's collection. This is seen as a major blow to the library, 
    - but it's not necessarily the final destruction.

640 CE Muslim: (Muslim conquest):
    - Some accounts claim that the Muslim conquest of Alexandria led to the destruction of the library, 
        with Caliph Omar ordering the books to be burned, according to the BAS Library. However, this account is disputed, 
        and some scholars believe it may be an exaggeration or a later invention. 
    - The Library of Alexandria wasn't destroyed in a single event but rather experienced a gradual decline and 
    - several incidents of damage and destruction. 
    - The 48 BCE fire is the most widely cited event, but it's unclear how much damage it caused. 
    - The Serapeum destruction in 391 CE is another significant event, but it didn't completely destroy the library. 
    - The 640 CE Muslim conquest and the alleged burning of the library by Caliph Omar is a controversial claim, 
        with some scholars disputing its accuracy.
